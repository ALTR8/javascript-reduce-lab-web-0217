JavaScript Reduce Lab
---

## Objectives

1. Practice using a reduce function
2. Practice iterating over different abstractions

## Introduction

- Briefly review what students learned while writing their own `reduce()`
- Have them go back (https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/javascript-reduce) and review if they don't feel ready for a lab

##

- Test students implementation using different inputs
- Be sure to test failures! Null collections should not work, for example
- BUT the students' solution should work with arrays as well as objects
- Don't just test the students' `reduce()`, have them write other functions that make use of it (developing the narrative arc of the lesson)

## Resources

- [MDN: Array.prototype.reduce()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce)
